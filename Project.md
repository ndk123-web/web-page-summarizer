|-----------|----------------|
| **Popup** | Entry point. Handles basic extraction and sidebar injection triggers. |
| **Content Script** | The "Bridge". Reads DOM content and injects the Sidebar React Root into the page. |
| **Sidebar** | Main interactive component. Handles chat logic, settings, and UI rendering inside the host page. |
| **Background** | (Service Worker) Handles heavy lifting, API calls, and persistent state management. |
